# 🎯 Customer Segmentation Project

Overview

This Customer Segmentation Project aims to classify and group customers into distinct segments based on purchasing behaviors and other key attributes. The insights derived from this segmentation allow businesses to target their marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and personalize services to meet specific customer needs.

# Key Objectives

1.📊 Segment Customers: Group customers into meaningful clusters based on purchase history, demographics, and behavior.

2.🔍 Understand Customer Profiles: Gain insights into each customer group’s characteristics to drive personalized marketing strategies.

3.📈 Improve Business Decision-Making: Use segmentation data to tailor offerings, increase sales, and enhance customer satisfaction.

# Features
1. Data Preprocessing :
     Cleaning and transforming raw data for analysis.
     Handling missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
     Visualization of customer behavior across various features (age, spending patterns, frequency of purchases).
     Insights into how different attributes contribute to customer segmentation.
4. Clustering Techniques :
     Implementation of algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to group customers into segments.
